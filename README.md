## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

I focused on trying something new that I've never work with, in this case was SASS and I felt really comfortable using it, however there was some things that I had to search in the docummentation. Also, I'm trying to improve my JavaScript level.
Note: THIS VERSION MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH HIGH INPUT VALUES => this is related to the design, not to its function.
Any suggestion is more than welcome.
You can see my contact below if you pleased to.
